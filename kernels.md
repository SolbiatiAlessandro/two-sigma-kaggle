This are the kernels I am going through with some comments

- 1 [Getting Started](https://www.kaggle.com/dster/two-sigma-news-official-getting-started-kernel)
Introductory kernel that explains how to use APIs

- 2 [EDA, feature engineering and everyhing](https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/eda-feature-engineering-and-everything)
This is the most upvoted Kernel, I am starting from here to understand data and how to approach the task

- 3 [Bird-Eye View + NN Approach](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishpatel26/bird-eye-view-of-two-sigma-nn-approach)
This has a lot of nice plots, and then basically throw everything (not the second dataset tough) into an NN. Is mentioned in [2]
