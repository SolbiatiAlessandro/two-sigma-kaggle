Since this is my first Kaggle Competition along side kernels I will read a lot about how to actually compete in a Kaggle competition.
Here are the resources I found and I am reading

- 1 [How to rank 10% in your first Kaggle Competition](http://dnc1994.com/2016/05/rank-10-percent-in-first-kaggle-competition-en/)

- 2 [Beating Kaggle the Easy way](http://www.ke.tu-darmstadt.de/lehre/arbeiten/studien/2015/Dong_Ying.pdf)

- 3 [Previous competition winner interview on github](https://github.com/ChenglongChen/Kaggle_CrowdFlower/blob/master/BlogPost/BlogPost.md)
