	<ul><b>[1]</b>: This kernel is a baseline with lightLGB, the main focus was on train/validation split (using 0.8 separation) and on metric function (compute sortino), the learning rate is pretty weird tough, it spikes up to 0.51 and then it goes down and then learn gradually, not that much. Uses early stopping so the model is picking 0.51. <img src="trainings/1.png"></ul>
