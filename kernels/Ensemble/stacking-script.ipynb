However, while you're iterating on your model it's reasonable to try something out, change the model a bit, and try it again.  Unfortunately, if you try to simply re-run the code, or even refresh the browser page, you'll still be running on the same Kernel execution session you had been running before, and the `twosigmanews` module will still throw errors.  To get around this, you need to explicitly restart your Kernel execution session, which you can do by pressing the Restart button in the Kernel Editor's bottom Console tab:\n",
